<p>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy got its start in 1978 as a radio series written by Douglas Adams that was broadcast in the UK.  It was a comedy series based on ideas Adams had partially come up with while lying drunk in a field.  The series was quite successful and developed a large following, which prompted Adams to expand on the series by publishing the novels.</p>
<p>The radio series was later continued after Adams' passing to include content from the later novels.</p><br><br>
